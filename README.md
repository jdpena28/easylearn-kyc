### OPTIMIZATION
Apply **React [Memoization](https://www.qed42.com/insights/coe/javascript/optimize-your-react-app-performance-memoization)** to Prevent Unnecessary Re-renders in the Three Nodes of DOM. 

Cause of Optimization: \
We are using CONTEXT API for Storing States which we use on the root or index page the Context to avoid unnecessary re-render we must optimize the React Application 
\ 
2nd Option: \
We can also checkout the new emerging state management instead of using Redux the [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)
